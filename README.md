  :small_orange_diamond: [Country_Search](https://horobird.github.io/Country_Search) is a small project to showcase my JavaScript skills. It was created with Parcel. For dating and setting
additional features [refer to documentation](https://parceljs.org/).     
  :small_orange_diamond: The project implemented the capabilities of the API  [https://restcountries.com](https://restcountries.com).

  :small_orange_diamond:As you enter a letter, the program searches for countries.       
  - If there are more than one countries found, then the flag and the official name of the country are displayed.
